# ContactBox
ContactBox is an easy to use contact form modal that stays in the corner of your screen.
It allows your visitors to contact you easily from any page of your website.
This plugin is in javascript (no need of jQuery) and needs you to handle the backend side.

## How to use:
`npm install contactbox`

Include the contactbox.min.css and contactbox.min.js files in your page.

Create an endpoint in your backend. The form is sent by a POST request, including `email` and `mesage`.

Add the following script:
```
new ContactBox({
    endpoint: 'http://yourwebsite.com/post.php', // Define your endpoint for the POST request
    title: 'Send us a message', // optional, the message on the top of the box
    successMsg: 'Thanks, your message has been sent!', // optional, the success message
});
```

## In development
- Option to change the position of the modal
- Different themes
